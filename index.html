        <h2>Introduction</h2>

            It uses Git software, which provides distributed version control of access control, bug tracking,<br>
            software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.<br><br>
            Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.</p>
        <h2>Founding</h2>
        <p>The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.<br>
            The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, <br>
            Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta
            release.<br>
